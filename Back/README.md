# Badge Verification API

Welcome to the Badge Verification API! This API is designed to verify badges by analyzing uploaded images. It's built using Node.js and provides a simple yet effective way to ensure the validity of badge images. Below, you'll find a functional overview of how this API works.

## Overview

This API provides endpoints to upload badge images and verify their authenticity. It's built to be straightforward and easy to use. Here's a breakdown of its main components:

### Uploading and Verifying Badges

- **Endpoint**: `/api/upload`
- **Method**: POST
- **Functionality**: This is the primary endpoint of the API. You can upload a badge image through this endpoint. The API then processes the image to determine whether it meets the set criteria for a valid badge.

### How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: When you upload an image, the API first checks if the image was successfully received. If no image is found in the request, it responds with an error message.
2. **Verification Process**: Once an image is received, the API uses the `verifyBadge` function to analyze the image. This function checks various aspects of the image to ensure it meets the badge criteria.
3. **Response**: After analysis, the API responds in two possible ways:

   - If the image fails the verification, the API provides a message indicating the badge is invalid, along with the reasons for its invalidation.
   - If the image passes all checks, the API confirms that the badge has been verified successfully.

### Default Route

- **Endpoint**: `/`
- **Method**: GET
- **Functionality**: This route provides a welcome message. It's a simple way to verify that the API is running correctly.

### Error Handling

The API includes error handling for two main scenarios:

- **404 Not Found**: If a request is made to a non-existent route, the API responds with a "Page not found" message.
- **General Errors**: For other errors (like server issues), the API provides a generic error message to inform the user that something went wrong.

## Getting Started

To start using this API, you can send requests to the provided endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate it into your frontend application.

## Conclusion

This Badge Verification API is a robust solution for ensuring the authenticity of badge images. Its straightforward approach to image verification makes it an ideal choice for applications that require badge validation.
